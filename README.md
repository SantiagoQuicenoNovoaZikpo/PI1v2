# Movie Recommendation System API

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** that utilizes **FastAPI** to serve various endpoints related to movie data. The project involves extracting and processing data from two datasets: `credits.csv` and `movies_dataset.csv`, which contain detailed information about movies, including cast, crew, revenue, budget, and more. The processed data is then used to create a set of API endpoints that provide movie-related information such as the number of movies released in a particular month or day, movie scores, and details about specific actors and directors.

## Datasets

- **Credits Dataset (`credits.csv`)**: Contains information about the cast and crew of various movies.
- **Movies Dataset (`movies_dataset.csv`)**: Contains additional details about movies, including titles, release dates, budgets, revenues, and more.

## Data Processing

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

1. **Unnesting the Data**: The `cast` and `crew` columns in the `credits` dataset were un-nested to extract meaningful information.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the `revenue` column were replaced with 0, and rows with missing `release_date` were dropped.
3. **Data Normalization**: Dates were normalized to the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, and numeric columns were converted for consistency.
4. **Calculating Return on Investment (ROI)**: A new column `return` was created by dividing `revenue` by `budget`.
5. **Merging Datasets**: The `credits` and `movies` datasets were merged on the `id` column to create a unified DataFrame.

## API Endpoints

The API provides several endpoints to interact with the movie data:

1. **`/cantidad_filmaciones_mes`**: Returns the number of movies released in a given month.
   - **Parameter**: `mes` (string) - Month in Spanish (e.g., "enero" for January).
   
2. **`/cantidad_filmaciones_dia`**: Returns the number of movies released on a specific day of the week.
   - **Parameter**: `dia` (string) - Day in Spanish (e.g., "Lunes" for Monday).
   
3. **`/score_titulo`**: Returns the score of a specific movie based on its title.
   - **Parameter**: `titulo_de_la_filmación` (string) - The title of the movie.
   
4. **`/votos_titulo`**: Provides the total number of votes and average score for a movie.
   - **Parameter**: `titulo_de_la_filmación` (string) - The title of the movie.
   
5. **`/get_actor`**: Returns details about an actor's filmography, including the number of movies, total revenue, and average return.
   - **Parameter**: `nombre_actor` (string) - The name of the actor.
   
6. **`/get_director`**: Provides information about a director's success, including movie details, revenue, and average score.
   - **Parameter**: `nombre_director` (string) - The name of the director.
