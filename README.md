Movie Recommendation System API
Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that utilizes FastAPI to serve various endpoints related to movie data. The project involves extracting and processing data from two datasets: credits.csv and movies_dataset.csv, which contain detailed information about movies, including cast, crew, revenue, budget, and more. The processed data is then used to create a set of API endpoints that provide movie-related information such as the number of movies released in a particular month or day, movie scores, and details about specific actors and directors.

Datasets
Credits Dataset (credits.csv): Contains information about the cast and crew of various movies.
Movies Dataset (movies_dataset.csv): Contains additional details about movies, including titles, release dates, budgets, revenues, and more.
Data Processing
Data Cleaning and Transformation
Unnesting the Data: The cast and crew columns in the credits dataset were un-nested to extract meaningful information.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the revenue column were replaced with 0, and rows with missing release_date were dropped.
Data Normalization: Dates were normalized to the format YYYY-MM-DD, and numeric columns were converted for consistency.
Calculating Return on Investment (ROI): A new column return was created by dividing revenue by budget.
Merging Datasets: The credits and movies datasets were merged on the id column to create a unified DataFrame.
API Endpoints
The API provides several endpoints to interact with the movie data:

/cantidad_filmaciones_mes: Returns the number of movies released in a given month.
Parameter: mes (string) - Month in Spanish (e.g., "enero" for January).
/cantidad_filmaciones_dia: Returns the number of movies released on a specific day of the week.
Parameter: dia (string) - Day in Spanish (e.g., "Lunes" for Monday).
/score_titulo: Returns the score of a specific movie based on its title.
Parameter: titulo_de_la_filmación (string) - The title of the movie.
/votos_titulo: Provides the total number of votes and average score for a movie.
Parameter: titulo_de_la_filmación (string) - The title of the movie.
/get_actor: Returns details about an actor's filmography, including the number of movies, total revenue, and average return.
Parameter: nombre_actor (string) - The name of the actor.
/get_director: Provides information about a director's success, including movie details, revenue, and average score.
Parameter: nombre_director (string) - The name of the director.
